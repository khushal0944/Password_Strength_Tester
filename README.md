# Password Strength Tester

A real-time password strength tester built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This interactive tool helps users create stronger passwords by providing immediate feedback on password strength and specific suggestions for improvement.

## Features

- **Real-time Feedback**: Automatically updates the strength meter and feedback messages as you type.
- **Visual Indicator**: Color-coded strength meter to easily identify password strength.
- **Detailed Suggestions**: Provides specific feedback on how to improve password strength, including:
  - Minimum length requirement
  - Inclusion of lowercase letters
  - Inclusion of uppercase letters
  - Inclusion of numbers
  - Inclusion of special characters

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: As the user types a password, the strength meter evaluates the password in real-time.
2. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - Length of the password (must be at least 8 characters).
   - Presence of lowercase and uppercase letters.
   - Inclusion of numbers and special characters.
3. **Strength Calculation**: Deductions are made based on the absence or low count of required character types.
